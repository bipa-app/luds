## Support for LNURL-pay currencies

This document describes an extension to the [payRequest](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/06.md) base specification that allows the `WALLET` to send money to a `SERVICE` denominating the amount in a different currency. The features proposed enable many use cases ranging from denominating an invoice in a foreign currency to a remittance-like experience.

The main features provided by this extension are:
- `SERVICE` **MUST** inform `WALLET` what currencies it supports
- `WALLET` **MAY** request an invoice with an amount denominated in one of the currencies
- `WALLET` **MAY** request to the payment to be converted into one of the currencies

The extension is opt-in and backward compatible. Further, a supporting `WALLET` can always tell if a `SERVICE` is also supporting beforehand so the communication is never ambiguous.

### Wallet-side first request

The first request is unchanged from the base specification.

### Service-side first response

`SERVICE` must alter its JSON response to the first request to include a `currencies` field, as follows:

```typescript
type BaseResponse = {
    tag: "payRequest",
    metadata: string,
    callback: string,
    maxSendable: number,
    minSendable: number
}

type Currency = {
  code: string, // Code of the currency, used as an ID for it. E.g.: BRL
  name: string, // Name of the currency. E.g.: Reais
  symbol: string, // Symbol of the currency. E.g.: R$
  decimals: number, // Integer; Number of decimal places. E.g.: 2
  multiplier: number, // Double; Number of millisatoshis per smallest unit of currency. E.g.: 5405.405
  convertible?: bool // Whether the payment can be converted into the currency
}

type ExtendedResponse = BaseResponse & {
  currencies: Currency[]
}
```

```diff
{
  "tag": "payRequest",
  "metadata": '[["text/plain","$kenu ⚡ bipa.app"]]',
  "callback": "https://api.bipa.app/ln/request/invoice/kenu",
  "maxSendable": 1000000000,
  "minSendable": 1000,
+ "currencies": [
+   {
+     "code": "BRL",
+     "name": "Real",
+     "symbol": "R$",
+     "decimals": 2,
+     "multiplier": 5404.405,
+     "convertible": true
+   }
+ ]
}
```

- The inclusion of the `currencies` field implies the support of this extension
- The inclusion of a `currency` implies it can be used for denomination of an amount
- The inclusion of a `convertible currency` implies the `SERVICE` can quote and guarantee a price for a given currency
- The `multiplier` is not guaranteed by the `SERVICE` and is subject to change
- The `code` of a `currency` will be used as an identifier for the next request and must be unique
- The `code` must be according to [ISO-4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) if possible
- The order of the `currencies` may be interpreted by the `WALLET` as the receiving user preference for a currency

### Wallet-side second request

Upon receiving the `currencies` field on the response, the `WALLET` shows the user it has the option of denominating the amount in one of the `currencies` or for the payment to be creditted as a different `currency` for the receiver.

The inputs that must be gathered from the user are:
- An optional denominating currency and amount (`CURRENCY_D` and `AMOUNT_D`)
- An optional `convert` currency (`CURRENCY_C`)

The most general case has all the parameters set.
It will generate an invoice with the amount equivalent to `AMOUNT_D` `CURRENCY_D`, which will be converted into `CURRENCY_C` by the `SERVICE` upon payment.

`<callback><?|&>amount=<AMOUNT_D>.<CURRENCY_D>&convert=<CURRENCY_C>`

Each combination of parameters is valid and generates a different use case.
- Omitting the `amount` denomination implies the invoice is for millisatoshis (base spec)
- Omitting the `convert` implies the receiver will get BTC from the payment, no matter the `amount` denomination

Note that the amount provided in all requests is always an integer number interpreted as the smallest unit of the selected `currency`. The smallest unit needs to be according to the `decimals` parameter, so the `WALLET` has all the needed information to receive input and show output properly.

### Service-side second response

Upon receiving a currency-denominated request from `WALLET`, the `SERVICE` must return an invoice with an amount matching the converted rate for the amount in that currency. The rate used does not need to match the `multiplier` first informed.

If the `WALLET` requested an actual conversion, the `SERVICE` must provide an additional field alongside the invoice informing the guaranteed `converted` amount that will be creditted to the receiver upon payment. The `converted` amount, and therefore the conversion rate, must be guaranteed by the `SERVICE` for as long as the invoice is not expired. The `converted` amount must be denominated in the smallest unit of the currency, just like the `amount` parameter.

```typescript
type BaseResponse = {
  pr: string,
  routes: [],
}

type ExtendedResponse = BaseResponse & {
  converted?: number, // Integer; Present if and only if `convert` was received.
}
```

```diff
{
  "pr": "lnbc1230n1pjknkl...ju36m3lyytlwv42fee8gpt6vd2v",
  "routes": [],
+ "converted": 123
}
```

### Examples
These examples show all the possible uses of this extension by a supporting `WALLET` and `SERVICE`.

#### Payer queries the payee service
`GET <service>/.well-known/lnurlp/<identifier>`
```json
{
  "tag": "payRequest",
  "callback": "bipa.app/callback",
  "metadata": "...",
  "minSendable": 1000,
  "maxSendable": 1000000,
  "currencies": [
    {
      "code": "BRL",
      "name": "Reais",
      "symbol": "R$",
      "decimals": 2,
      "multiplier": 5405.405,
      "convertible": true
    },
    {
      "code": "USDT",
      "name": "Tether",
      "symbol": "₮",
      "decimals": 6,
      "multiplier": 26315.789
    }
  ]
}
```
###### Payer sends 538 sats
```json5
// GET <callback>?amount=538000
{ "pr": "(invoice of 538 sats)" }
```
###### Payer sends 1 BRL worth of BTC
```json5
// GET <callback>?amount=100.BRL
{ "pr": "(invoice of 538 sats)" }
```
###### Payer sends 538 sats to be converted into BRL
```json5
// GET <callback>?amount=538000&convert=BRL
{ "converted": 100, "pr": "(invoice of 538 sats)" }
```
###### Payer sends 1 BRL worth of BTC to be converted into USDT
```json5
// GET <callback>?amount=100.BRL&convert=USDT
{ "converted": 200000, "pr": "(invoice of 538 sats)" }
```
###### Payer sends 1 BRL worth of BTC to unsupported service
```json5
// GET <callback>?amount=100.BRL
{ "status": "ERROR", "reason": "..." }
```
